        <h1>Projects</h1>

        <h2>PC and VR Chat System</h2>
        <div class = "container">
        <iframe width="100%" height="100%" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lmEhlf-c8-M" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen class = "video"></iframe>
        </div>
        <br /><p>While working at Venu, this was the main feature that I was in charge of refactoring and maintaining. I collaborated with the design team to develop this social feature that mainly allowed Tech Support team to effectively communicate and troubleshoot problems that may arise with attendees of Venu events. This social feature is easily interactable cross platform on the PC and in Virtual Reality.</p>

        <h2>Emoji Spawning System</h2>
        <div class = "container">
        <iframe width="100%" height="100%" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZKgyGc7Q9tQ" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen class = "video"></iframe>
        </div>
        <br /><p> This is another social feature I enjoyed collaborating with the design team on while working at Venu. Utilized free to use assets and Unity's particle system. The emoji spawn system is accessed via a Menu in game. Clicking on a button in the menu spawns the unique coressponding Emoji sprites </p>

        <h2>ANX Dread: VR Anxiety Experience</h2>
        <div class = "container">
        <iframe width="100%" height="100%" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/COWqeVOVaAA" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen class = "video"></iframe>
        </div>
        <br /><p>This project aims to explore the application of virtual reality in support of furthering studies regarding managing stress and anxiety. Specifically, the system was designed to explore usersâ€™ reactions to simple tasks in simulated stressful and fictional settings with respect to specific game elements.</p>

        <h2>Music and Light</h2>
        <div class = "container">
          <iframe width="100%" height="100%" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_CNPk8w3ZSg" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen class = "video"></iframe>
        </div>
        <br /><p>This was a group capstone project for the Computing for Interactive Arts minor. The goal of this project was to create a music reactive light projection-mapped onto the front of the Kennedy Library of the Cal Poly SLO campus. We did our best to overcome the obstacles that came about while working on this project during the COVID-19 pandemic.<br /><br />
        This project was achieved through the use of Unity3D and utilizing the library Lasp. By using a combination of particle systems, C# scripts, and blender rendering, we were able to develop a system that adjusts the effects shown depending on the music input.

        <h2>Gravity Funhouse VR</h2>
        <div class = "container">
          <iframe width="100%" height="100%" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Jpxk8v55rfU" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen class = "video"></iframe>
        </div>
        <br /><p>IllusiVR is a VR experience developed via the use of Unity3D and SteamVR. The goal of this project was to create a house with multiple room and experiment with differing directions of gravity. This project was inspired by Half-Life Alyx.<br>
